# Screenshots

This directory contains screenshots for the package documentation on pub.dev.

## How to Add Screenshots

1. Take screenshots of your keyboard in action (use the running example app)
2. Save them with these names:
   - `numeric_keyboard.png` - Screenshot of the numeric keyboard layout
   - `text_keyboard.png` - Screenshot of the text keyboard layout
   - `alphanumeric_keyboard.png` - Screenshot of the alphanumeric keyboard layout

3. Recommended image specifications:
   - Format: PNG
   - Size: 800x600px or similar (maintain aspect ratio)
   - Keep file size under 500KB for faster loading

## Taking Screenshots

You can take screenshots from the running example app:

```bash
cd example
flutter run -d chrome
```

Use your browser's screenshot tool or OS screenshot utility to capture the keyboards.

Alternatively, use Flutter DevTools screenshot feature while the app is running.
